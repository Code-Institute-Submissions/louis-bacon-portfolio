Hello, 

Welcome to my self-titled portfolio website. This is a hub for me to advertise the many products and services that I offer as a business and a person.

This website constitutes my First Milestone Project for the Full Stack Developer Course delivered by the <a href="https://codeinstitute.net" target="_blank">Code Institute</a>. I aim to give users an immediate insight into what I do and ensure that they can intuitively find out what I provide, what they need from me and how to get it. My varying skillsets do not necessarily fit together naturally, so a great deal of effort has gone into simplifying my offering.

## Technologies Used

The project uses the follwing coding languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

The following frameworks/libraries were also used:
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Font Awesome

## Credits

The following features on the site are based on <a href="https://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> documentation:
> The Carousel used for the hero image at the top of the mobile page and for item scrolling on the T-shirts page
> Sign-up and contact forms, as well as the e-mail subscription bar
> Buttons

All icons used on the site were taken from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/start/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>.

## Issues

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.
